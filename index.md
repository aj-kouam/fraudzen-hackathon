# FraudZen Hackathon

Welcome to the FraudZen Hackathon! This event is dedicated to advancing mobile network security, privacy protection, and fraud detection strategies. Participants will use powerful simulation tools, **FraudZen** ([FraudZen Simulator](https://gitlab.inria.fr/simbox-fraud-mitigation/fraudzen)) and **En-WDM** ([En-WDM Legitimate Dataset Generator](https://gitlab.inria.fr/simbox-fraud-mitigation/legitimate-mobile-datasets-generation/en-wdm)), to develop innovative solutions for real-world challenges in mobile network fraud and security.

## Hackathon Poles

### Pole 1: Mobile Network Architecture, Knowledge Extraction, and Modeling
Focuses on understanding the structure and data dynamics of mobile networks, emphasizing mobility and traffic simulations.

- **Object of Study**: Mobile network modeling and simulation (no fraud simulation).
- **Objectives**:
    - Enhance FraudZen by integrating advanced 4G/5G/6G network features for improved modeling accuracy.
    - Extract knowledge on user social, mobility, and traffic patterns within mobile networks.
    - Propose, implement, and validate new human mobility models or spatial contexts within En-WDM or FraudZen.
    - Develop and integrate new traffic models into the simulator, enhancing simulation realism.

### Pole 2: Mobile Network Data Privacy Protection through Anonymization
Focuses on applying anonymization techniques to secure user identities in mobile datasets.

- **Object of Study**: Regular mobile datasets (no fraud simulation).
- **Objectives**:
    - Investigate and apply pseudonymization methods like k-anonymity, differential privacy, and t-closeness.
    - Explore privacy attacks on anonymized datasets, identifying potential vulnerabilities.
    - Balance privacy and data utility, proposing strategies that maximize both privacy and usability.

### Pole 3: Offensive Security
Simulates fraud strategies within mobile networks to understand and model fraud tactics effectively.

- **Object of Study**: SIMBox fraud strategy simulation.
- **Objectives**:
    - Develop fraud models within FraudZen that emulate realistic user behaviors.
    - Validate model effectiveness and cost efficiency for fraudsters.
    - Analyze implications for network security, including detection feasibility and real-world challenges.

### Pole 4: Defensive Security
Innovates approaches to detect SIMBox fraud using artificial intelligence techniques.

- **Object of Study**: SIMBox fraud detection solutions.
- **Objectives**:
    - Develop adaptive AI-based detection methods that track evolving fraud patterns.
    - Integrate meta-learners to address specific fraud behaviors and federate them into a comprehensive detection model.
    - Establish evaluation metrics to assess detection effectiveness against emerging threats.
